#### Schema Overview

First off, I'm going to preface this with this schema was not intended for public release, and more than likely will not be modified and rectified as such, plugins will be modified individually and released for public use, however ANY plugins in this pack are not intended to support customized environments *unless* you customize it yourself. Support will be provided if you need help doing it, but there is no more promise than that, unless there's compensation involved, I won't make your modifications for you, as I just don't have the time.

Let's begin.
FFI-HL2RP was a server project I worked on for about a month every day and created all this content for it, the intention was to try and automate some of the more tedious tasks, and provide a healthy focus to the Citizen faction, the primary instances for this were the production system and the identity system, allowing an easier run CWU production that supports espionage and theft, the same sported for the identity system, almost everything in the schema is tied to the ID cards.

Save for the base schema and some other tidbits, everything in here was made by me, and I reserve the right their contents, if the plugins are modified in any manner, credit must be maintained.
